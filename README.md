# Sales-Dashboard-Using-Excel
Excel Project

I am thrilled to present my Sales Dashboard project, a demonstration of my expertise in data analysis and visualization using Excel. In this project, I utilized my skills to transform raw sales data into insightful visual representations that aid in strategic decision-making.

The project began with data cleaning and manipulation, where I ensured data accuracy and consistency. Leveraging Excel's pivot table functionality, I delved into the dataset to uncover crucial insights, such as subcategory-wise sales distribution, the top 5 customers contributing to profits, and profit analysis by category.

The true essence of this project lies in the creation of an interactive dashboard. Using pivot tables and pivot charts, I synthesized complex data into easily digestible visualizations. This dashboard not only enhances data accessibility but also empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions by quickly identifying trends, outliers, and opportunities
